      <action type="update">
        New version of iPlug-SE.
        This version uses the project 'nutchgui' (version 'v03') and nutch version 1.0 for crawling.
        The main difference is the introduction of "adaptive crawling", where crawl cycles won't take
        so much time anymore'

      <action type="update">
        Using a new scoring algorithm (WebGraph), which replaces the old and instable OPIC scoring.
        Scores won't increase permanently anymore, since score will be calculated completely new after
        each crawl.
